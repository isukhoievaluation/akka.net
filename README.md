**WinTail:** *NIX systems have the tail command built-in to monitor changes to a file (such as tailing log files), whereas Windows does not. I recreated tail for Windows.

**ChartApp:** I built my own version of Resource Monitor using Windows Forms, data visualization tools built into .NET, and [Performance Counters](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.performancecounter.aspx "PerformanceCounter Class - C#").

**GithubActors:** I built a sophisticated GitHub scraper that can simultaneously retrieve data from multiple GitHub repos at once.
